# Wonky Work — TODO

The first iteration delivers **Wonky Write**: sign-in, drive, sharing, a real-time
collaborative editor, comments, suggestions, history, themes, import and export. The
specs in `specs/` remain the source of truth. This file lists what is not done yet.

**Wonky Sheets is paused.** Its state and how to resume it are in
[specs/wonky_sheets/STATUS.md](specs/wonky_sheets/STATUS.md).

Status legend: ☐ open · ◐ in progress · ☑ done (done items are removed once they are
committed and verified).

## Wonky Write — deferred features (in planned order)

1. ☑ **Theme editor UI** (Write 06 §10): `/themes/:uuid?doc=` with a live preview (sample or the document, light/dark, pages/pageless, zoom), a catalog-driven inspector for every theme property, contrast warnings with *Fix*, dark derivation and overrides, duplicate/rename/delete/restore, revisions, conflict dialog, *Apply to document* and *Set as my default*; all `write.theme.*` commands, undoable. Still open: hover-outlining of matching blocks in the preview.
2. ☑ **Import/export formats** (Write 07): DOCX, ODT, RTF and EPUB exporters plus DOCX, ODT and RTF importers in `wonky_write_core`. Exporting and re-importing our own files gives back the same document for all 8 themes, except that RTF brings heading numbers back as text. Server `writeExport.export` covers all 10 formats, with bundled fonts in `web/fonts` and images read from storage; `drive.import` and `convertForInsert` accept HTML, DOCX, ODT and RTF. In the app, File › Download lists every format, and File › Import / Insert from file accept them; the import banner shows on first open. Still open:
   - the server export cache and the isolate pool; large documents still export on the client;
   - SVG images in DOCX/ODT/RTF/EPUB (rendered as placeholders);
   - comments in DOCX/ODT exports and embedded DOCX fonts (both P2);
   - LibreOffice and epubcheck validation in CI.
3. ☑ **MCP** (suite 09, Write 09) — `/mcp` Streamable HTTP route on the web server (custom
   `mcp_dart` transport; MCP 2026-07-28 stateless + initialize-era sessions), PAT bearer auth
   with scopes, host/origin checks and rate limits; `ToolExecutor` with `drive.*`, `write.*`
   (23 tools), `comments.*`, `versions.*`, `changes.revert`, resources and prompts; UI bridge
   (`uiBridge.connect` + `UiBridgeHub`, client bridge with shared `ui.*` and `ui.write.*`
   tools, control pill with Stop); `wonky_mcp_stdio`; Settings › Developer (tokens with
   scopes/expiry, connection snippets, bridge status). Remaining:
   - resource subscriptions (`notifications/resources/updated`) and MCP 2026
     `subscriptions/listen`; OAuth 2.1;
   - `write.compare_versions`, `write.get_theme`, `write.create_theme`/`update_theme`
     (with the theme editor), the `write.search` regex timeout;
   - the UI-bridge hub is per server instance (no cross-instance relay yet);
   - `ui.write.get_layout_info` does not report the visible Delta range yet.

4. ☑ **AI assistant** (suite 10, Write 09 §5): server `AnthropicClient` (HTTP + SSE, retries with backoff/`retry-after`, refusal fallbacks, beta features that degrade on a 400) and agent loop (`assistant` endpoint: chat stream, threads, stop, destructive-change confirmation, inline rewrite/continue/summarize/outline/explain, proofread with the strict `report_issues` tool; tools generated from the MCP registry and bound to the open document; prompt caching; daily token budget, 2 concurrent requests, `AiUsage`); one run = one undo step "AI: …" on the requesting client (`onBehalfOfSessionId`/`groupId`); the shared `AssistantPanel` (threads, streaming Markdown, tool chips with Show/Undo, context chips, Stop, quick prompts, Edit/Suggest, privacy notice, "AI isn't configured" state); inline AI (selection ✨ menu, `/ai`, Mod+J prompt, preview with Replace/Insert below/Try again/Refine/Discard and a word diff, continue writing, AI suggestions with `via: ai`); Tools › Summarize document / Generate outline / Proofread document; Settings › AI (enable, quality, usage, clear history). Enable it with `anthropicApiKey` in `config/passwords.yaml`. Still open:
   - the `ui.write.get_ai_preview` UI-bridge tool, and `write.compare_versions` / `write.get_theme` for the assistant (they don't exist as MCP tools yet);
   - a live check against the real API (no key in development); the run and concurrency registry is per server instance;
   - continue writing shows its ghost text in a card at the caret, not inline in the text layout.
5. ☑ **Offline persistence** (suite 12 §1): per-user `write_cache_<userId>.db` on `sqlite_async`
   (web: `sqlite3.wasm` + `db_worker.js` in `wonky_write/web/`, OPFS or IndexedDB; desktop: a
   file) with `LocalDocument` (+ server op log), the durable `LocalPendingOp` outbox (written
   before sending, 2 s chunks, resent with the same `clientOpId`, `RebaseTooOld` → "Save my
   offline changes as a copy"), `LocalUndoStack` and `LocalPendingUpload`. Documents open from
   the device first (stale-while-revalidate), can be created offline, and stay available when
   opened in the last 14 days (max 50) or made available offline (downloaded, drive badges,
   unavailable items dimmed). Closed documents with an outbox sync in the background; metadata
   changes are queued; the profile is cached for offline starts; the drive cache and queue are
   per user. Settings › Offline & storage shows usage, *Clear local data* and *Simulate offline*
   (`write.offline.simulate`, the `ConnectivityService.forceOffline` test hook). Still open:
   - the offline theme cache (documents opened offline use the default theme when their theme
     was never loaded) and offline comments;
   - "Offline storage is limited in this browser" for the IndexedDB fallback;
   - deleting the database file on desktop (tables are truncated, as on the web).

6. ☐ **Spellcheck** (Write 04, P1): a pure-Dart Hunspell-style checker and the editor hook.
7. ☐ **Editor extras:**
   - SE-4 in-place table cell editing (tables are edited through the table dialog today);
   - drag and drop of text, files and blocks (block-handle drag);
   - emoji picker and special characters;
   - image lightbox;
   - focus mode and typewriter scrolling.
8. ☐ **Notifications**: email digests (no mail provider is configured; the job only logs), mention emails, and the activity dashboard (07 §6).
9. ☐ **Quality**:
   - i18n beyond English (pseudo-locales);
   - golden tests on CI;
   - E2E `integration_test` journeys (11 §1.1);
   - extending CI to every package plus the dependency-rule check (01 §2.1);
   - a performance suite.
10. ☐ **Deployment**:
    - verify production builds served by the server at `/write/` and `/sheets/` (`serverpod run flutter_build`), with WASM and cross-origin-isolation headers;
    - the sign-in is shared on the single origin; in development the two `flutter run` origins (8101 and 8102) don't share it.
11. ☐ **Desktop** packaging (macOS first): native menubar, keychain sharing between apps, `wonkysheets://` / `wonkywrite://` URL schemes.

## Known issues

- Version restore uses the shell's server-side restore; undoing it restores the restore point (Write 08 §4.5).
- When a role is downgraded while editing, pending ops that are no longer allowed are discarded through a resync, not converted into suggestions.
- Recurring server jobs are re-registered on every server start under fixed identifiers.
- Search uses no full-text GIN index yet.
- shad tooltips and popovers swallow Esc; the toolbar works around this with `ToolbarEscapeScope`.
- PDF exports (client and server) cover Latin, Greek and Cyrillic with the bundled TTFs; CJK, Arabic and emoji fall back to placeholders until the fallback fonts are added.
